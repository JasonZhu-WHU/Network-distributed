## Homework 2

I select and answer 3 questions in chapter 1 as follows: P2 P25 P28

### P2.

The formula given in equation is 
$$
\frac {L} {R}
$$
which is the delay of one packet passing a link.

However, in this question, we need to figure out that the delay should consist of two parts.

Part 1: delay of first packer taking to pass N links
$$
\frac {L*N} {R}
$$
Part 2: delay of other P-1 packets
$$
\frac {L} {R} * (P-1)
$$
So the total delay is 
$$
\frac {L*N} {R} + \frac {L} {R} * (P-1)
$$
which is the formula for sending P such packets back-to-back over the N links.

### P25.

a. The bandwith-delay product is 
$$
\frac {20000KM*2Mbps} {2.5*10^8meters/second} = \frac {4} {25}M bits = 1.6*10^5bits
$$
b. File has 0.8 M bits, but the bandwidth-delay is only 0.16 M bits.

So the maximum number of bits that will be in the link at any given time is still 0.16 M bits
$$
1.6*10^5 bits
$$
c. My interpretation of the bandwidth-delay product is that it is the maximum number of bits that will be in the link at any given time under any condition.

d. It is similar to the length of  football field.
$$
\frac {20000KM} {1.6 * 10 ^ 5 bits}  = 125m
$$
e. Transmission rate is the bandwidth, so the width of a bit is
$$
\frac {s} {R}
$$

### P28.

a. Using the similar way we use in P2:
$$
\frac {20000KM} {2.5*10^8meters/second} * (\frac {0.8} {0.16} + 1) = 0.48s
$$
b. Using the similar way we use in a.:
$$
\frac {20000KM} {2.5*10^8meters/second} * (\frac {0.04} {0.16} + 1) * 20 = 0.1s * 20 = 2s
$$
c. Although the total sizes in these two ways are the same, the speed of passing one file completely is much more faster than the way of passing separate files. This is probably due to the delay of waiting which requires that  the sender cannot send a packet until the preceding one is acknowledged.
